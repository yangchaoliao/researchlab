  abstract={Understanding the complex structural behaviors of crumpled graphene at a fundamental level is of critical importance in various engineering and technological applications. Here, we present a coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) study for investigating structural behaviors of graphene sheets having varying sizes (or masses) during the crumpling process. The simulation results reveal that larger size graphene sheets at the initial two-dimension (2D) state tends to become more self-adhering and self-folding upon crumpling compared to the smaller ones, before forming a sphere-like highly crumpled structure. The fractal dimension of the crumpled graphene sheets, i.e., a measure of packing efficiency, is predicted to be D = 2.395 from our CG modeling, which is largely consistent with previous measurements. Remarkably, the size-dependence of various structural properties of the crumpled graphene sheets, including radius of gyration, hydrodynamic radius, and viscosity radius, can be quantitively described by the power-law scaling relationships during the crumpling process. By systematically evaluating shape descriptors, it is found that the overall crumpling behaviors of graphene sheets can be characterized by three different regimes (i.e., less, intermediate, and highly crumpled states), which are associated with edge-bending, self-adhesion, and further compression mechanisms, respectively. Our study provides fundamental insights into the size-dependent structural behavior of graphene sheets under crumpling, which is crucial to develop the structure-property relationships towards designing and engineering crumpled matter.}

  abstract={Theoretical analyses of the dynamic properties of a 2-2 multi-layered cement-based piezoelectric composite are presented based on the theory of piezoelasticity and D’Alembert’s principle. An arbitrary mechanical load acts on the free end of the composite in the form of pressure. The Taylor series expansion method is introduced for the arbitrary mechanical load, and the theoretical solutions of the composite are obtained mainly based on the eigenfunction expansion method, Duhamel integral, and Laplace transform. Comparisons between the theoretical results, numerical results, and four related theoretical studies are presented, and good agreements are found. Furthermore, the theoretical expression of magnification factors of the composite under the harmonic load are obtained and analyzed. In addition to providing a theoretical basis for the design and experimentation of 2-2 cement-based piezoelectric composites under the arbitrary loading, the theoretical methods presented in the article could be extended to analyze the dynamic characteristics of any multilayered composite structure.}

  abstract={Cement-based piezoelectric composite, has been widely used as a kind of smart material in structural health monitoring and active vibration control. However, transient dynamic loads such as impact loads may cause serious damage to the composite. Considering the electrode layer effect, this paper aimed to investigate the theoretical response of a 2-2 cement-based piezoelectric composite sensor subjected to an impact load. The vibration behaviors are analyzed by using the mode summation method and the virtual work principle. To simulate the impact load, transient haversine wave loads are assumed in the numerical simulation. Close agreements between theoretical and numerical solutions are found for peak transient haversine wave loads larger than 500 kPa, therefore proving the validity of the theory. Moreover, the influence of the electrode material and geometrical parameters on the dynamic characteristics of this sensor are considered. The present work should be beneficial to the design of this kind of sensor by taking into account the electrode layer effect.}

  abstract={Cement-based piezoelectric materials are widely used due to the fact that compared with common smart materials, they overcome the defects of structure-incompatibility and frequency inconsistency with a concrete structure. However, the present understanding of the mechanical behavior of cement-based piezoelectric smart materials under impact load is still limited. The dynamic characteristics under impact load are of importance, for example, for studying the anti-collision properties of engineering structures and aircraft takeoff-landing safety. Therefore, in this paper, an analytical model was proposed to investigate the dynamic properties of a 2-2 cement-based piezoelectric dual-layer stacked sensor under impact load based on the piezoelectric effect. Theoretical solutions are obtained by utilizing the variable separation and Duhamel integral method. To simulate the impact load and verify the theory, three types of loads, including atransient step load, isosceles triangle load and haversine wave load, are considered and the comparisons between the theoretical results, Li’s results and numerical results are presented by using the control variate method and good agreement is found. Furthermore, the influences of several parameters were discussed and other conclusions about this sensor are also given. This should prove very helpful for the design and optimization of the 2-2 cement-based piezoelectric dual-layer stacked sensor in engineering.}

  abstract={In this chapter, the mechanical behavior of supramolecular assemblies of two-dimensional (2D) materials simulated using coarse-graining (CG) modeling approaches is discussed. Taking graphene as an exemplary system of 2D materials, four different CG models of graphene and graphene oxide with distinct mapping schemes and parameterizations are introduced. The applications of these CG models to simulate supramolecular assemblies, such as 3D foams or nacre-inspired graphene-polymer nanocomposites, are discussed. First, the crumpling behaviors of pristine graphene and graphene with defects are reviewed, emphasizing the role of adhesion in the crumpling process. Next, the modeling of 3D graphene foams is discussed, in particular the effects of temperature on their structural, dynamic, and mechanical responses. Following the foams, multilayer graphene assemblies (MLGs) are introduced, and the role of strain localization effects and energy dissipation mechanisms are discussed. Finally, we will discuss how CG models can be used to reveal the strengthening role of 2D materials in nanocomposites (i.e., toughness, and mechanical and viscoelastic properties). The examples presented in this chapter highlight the capability of multiscale CG modeling toward unraveling the complex behaviors of supramolecular assemblies of 2D materials.}

  abstract={Atomistic modeling has significantly contributed to the establishment of computer simulations as the third pillar of science, together with experiments and theory. Atomistic modeling involves many disparate fields of science, ranging from classical and statistical mechanics to quantum chemistry, numerical methods, or algorithmic developments. The great depth of each of those individual areas makes the mastering of atomistic simulation a daunting challenge. In this chapter, we attempt to fill the gray area between fundamental theory and hands-on applications by providing a practical overview of the theoretical machinery underlying atomistic simulations while at the same time outlining software-agnostic guidelines to perform simulations. Our goal is for the reader to understand the fundamentals of atomistic modeling and to be able to carry out simple atomistic simulations responsibly. To that end, instead of extensively focusing on the intricacies of the foundational aspects, which are tremendously important for experts in the field, we focus on aspects of the simulations that the practitioner will need to control, and therefore understand, when carrying out a simulation. We expect the reader to have some working knowledge on thermodynamics, physics, and chemistry but not be an expert in statistical mechanics, quantum chemistry, or scientific computing. For the motivated self-learner, we have tried to provide references throughout the chapter to other work with more in-depth treatments of the different topics.}
