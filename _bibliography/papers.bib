  abstract={Glass ceramics are functional materials created through controlled crystallization of base glasses, combining properties of both glasses and ceramics. Typically with crystallinity below 0.9, their crystal sizes, from nanometers to micrometers, are governed by processing conditions and nucleating agents. Smaller crystals enhance optical transparency, while larger ones improve mechanical strength, making the optimization of this tradeoff a critical challenge in composition and process design. We address this challenge quantitatively using continuum-level multiphysics modeling for both electromagnetic wave propagation and material fracture, which generate guiding curves for optimal property selection. Integrating these models incorporating microstructure effects and experimental data where the chemistry is encoded, we establish a comprehensive composition-processing-microstructure-properties map. Crucially, the one-to-one mapping from the microstructure space to the performance enables a physics transfer approach, supporting data-driven glass development of glass ceramics with tailored optical and mechanical properties, for reduced experimental costs and accelerated processes of material design.}

  abstract={The exploration of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) offers promising prospects by leveraging their unique physical properties and expanding their versatile applications. Here, we investigate the crumpling behavior of GNRs via coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) simulations. By systematically varying the size and geometry (i.e., width and the aspect ratio), we systematically examine the potential energy, configuration, mechanical state, and internal structure of crumpled GNRs in detail. Our findings indicate that as the size of GNRs increases, the self-adhering and self-folding behaviors during the crumpling process become more pronounced. Crumpled GNRs with large sizes exhibit greater adhesion energy but lower out-of-plane strain energy due to the formation of more planar regions and fewer sharp crumples compared to smaller GNRs. By evaluating the relative shape anisotropy and representative configuration during crumpling, we identify two aspect ratio-dependent crumpling modes for GNRs, namely the edge-bending-dominated (EBD) and sliding- and folding-dominated (SFD) crumpling modes, respectively. Notably, the width-dependent critical aspect ratio controlling the transition between these modes provides valuable insights into understanding and predicting the crumpling behavior of GNRs with varying geometries. Moreover, our assessment of curvature and stress distributions and the cross-sectional patterns of crumpled GNRs further reveals a reduction of mechanical heterogeneity with increased sheet size. Our study highlights the critical role of geometry in the crumpling behavior of GNRs, which has significant implications for the tailored design of crumpled ribbon-like sheet materials.}

  abstract={The performance and reliability of electronic devices based on 2D materials under high electric fields are still the main issues limiting their rapid development. Many works have reported the electrical breakdown of channel materials and the breakdown electric field (EBD) has a wide distribution spanning at least one order of magnitude. hBN encapsulation has been demonstrated to be an effective strategy to improve the electric-field tolerance of 2D materials (e.g., 2H-MoTe2), which can effectively shield channel materials from contamination of O2 and H2O and further increase its EBD. However, a new mechanism of the protective effect of hBN that is different from the widely accepted passivation effect of hBN is revealed. Combining experimental characterizations, molecular dynamics, and density functional theory simulations, it is find that the formation of the hBN/MoTe2 interface can reduce the atomic activity of Te and introduce a physical barrier that prevents Te dissociation, ultimately improving the electric field tolerance. By employing dual hBN encapsulation and interface cleaning, the breakdown electric field and current are significantly increased by 150% and 210%, respectively. This approach offers a promising way to enhance the electric-field tolerance of 2D semiconductors and thus achieve robust 2D electronic devices.}

  abstract={Polymer-clay nanocomposites (PCNs) are commonly applied as multi-functional structural materials with exceptional thermomechanical properties, while maintaining the characteristics of lightweight and optical clarity. In this study, building upon previously developed coarse-grained (CG) models for nanoclay and poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), we employ molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to systematically investigate the thermomechanical properties of PCNs when arranged in stacked configurations. Incorporating stacked clay nanofillers into a polymer matrix, we systematically conduct shear and tensile simulations to investigate the influences of variations in weight percentage, system temperature, and nanoclay size on the thermomechanical properties of PCNs at a fundamental level. The weight percentage of nanoclay in nanocomposites proves to have a significant influence on both the shear and Young's modulus (e.g., the addition of 10 Wt% nanoclay leads to an increase of 32.6% in the Young's modulus), with each exhibiting greater mechanical strength in the in-plane direction compared to the out-of-plane direction, and the disparity between these two directions further widens with an increase in the weight percentage of nanoclay. Furthermore, the increase in the size of nanoclay contributes to an overall modulus enhancement in the composite while the growth reaches a saturation point after a certain threshold of about 10 nm. Our simulation results indicate that the overall dynamics of PMMA are suppressed due to the strong interactions between nanoclay and PMMA, where the confinement effect on local segmental dynamics of PMMA decays from the nanoclay-polymer interface to the polymer matrix. Our findings provide valuable molecular-level insights into microstructural and dynamical features of PCNs under deformation, emphasizing the pivotal role of clay-polymer interface in influencing the thermomechanical properties of the composite materials.}

  abstract={Polymer-grafted graphene (PgG) sheets are of interest in the development of functional nanocomposite materials for sensing, energy storage, and coatings. Although extensive studies have reported on various physical properties of PgG sheets, our understanding of the fundamental structural behavior of crumpled PgG sheets is still lacking. Here, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the crumpling behavior of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)-grafted graphene (PMMA-g-G) sheets with varying grafting densities based on previously developed coarse-grained (CG) models of PMMA and graphene. The simulation results reveal that the conformation of PMMA-g-G sheets in the initial equilibrium is controlled by the polymer grafting density and can be characterized into three different regimes (i.e., flat, folded, and wrinkled states), where the local distribution of PMMA on the graphene affects the local curvature of the sheet. By analyzing the total potential energy, shape descriptor, and conformation of the system during the crumpling process, it is found that the increase in grafting density reduces the self-adhering and self-folding behaviors of the sheet while making the bending behavior dominate the crumpling process. Moreover, the evaluation of the local curvature, stress distributions, and cross-sectional patterns of crumpled PMMA-g-G sheets further uncovers the reduced degree of mechanical heterogeneity due to the increased grafting density. Our study provides fundamental insights into the conformational behavior of PMMA-g-G sheets in equilibrium and crumpled states in relation to grafting density, which is crucial for establishing the structure–property relationships for leveraging crumpled polymer-grafted sheets in functional nanocomposites.}

  abstract={Piezoelectric stack energy harvesters, by virtue of the higher mechanical-to-electrical energy conversion capability in the d33 mode, have been used widely in various fields, such as railway system, roadway system, and human motion. Dynamic continuous models (DCMs) of piezoelectric stack energy harvesters can more accurately reflect the electromechanical behavior but are difficult to be established due to complex coupling between layers, particularly in the presence of arbitrary loads. The existing models often only considered harmonic excitations and often ignored electrodes and protective layers for simplicity. This paper proposed a comprehensive DCM of piezoelectric stack energy harvesters considering the electrodes and protective layers, which can be used to study the electromechanical performance of the energy harvester under both harmonic excitation and arbitrary excitation. Comparisons of the developed generic DCM with the analytical model based on piezoelasticity theory (a DCM which only considers the harmonic excitation) and the simplified model (a quasi-static continuous model which ignores inertia force of piezoelectric stack) are presented, with good agreements. Furthermore, the experiment results of two shapes of piezoelectric stacks, including tube and circular, are used to further confirm the reliability of the proposed model. In addition, effects of the electrode and protective layers on the dynamic properties are analyzed and discussed. The results show that the proposed DCM is effective and versatile to guide the design of piezoelectric stack energy harvesters subject to various types of loads.}

  abstract={Upon crumpling, graphene sheets yield intriguing hierarchical structures with high resistance to compression and aggregation, garnering a great deal of attention in recent years for their remarkable potential in a variety of applications. Here, we aim to understand the effect of Stone–Wales (SW) defects, i.e., a typical topological defect of graphene, on the crumpling behavior of graphene sheets at a fundamental level. By employing atomistically informed coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) simulations, we find that SW defects strongly influence the sheet conformation as manifested by the change in size scaling laws and weaken the self-adhesion of the sheet during the crumpling process. Remarkably, the analyses of the internal structures (i.e., local curvatures, stresses, and cross-section patterns) of crumpled graphene emphasize the enhanced mechanical heterogeneity and “glass-like” amorphous state elicited by SW defects. Our findings pave the way for understanding and exploring the tailored design of crumpled structure via defect engineering.}

However, there is a limited understanding of the mechanical properties, local molecular stiffness, and dynamic heterogeneity of this material at elevated temperatures and pressures. To address this, we employ all-atomistic (AA) molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to investigate the tensile behavior of Na-MMT clay over a wide temperature range (500 K to 1700 K) and pressures (200 atm to 100 000 atm). The results show that increasing the temperature significantly reduces the tensile modulus, strength, and failure strain, while pressure has a minor effect compared to temperature, as seen in the normalized pressure–temperature plot. Mean-square displacement (MSD) analysis reveals increased molecular stiffness with increasing pressure and decreasing temperature, indicating suppressed atomic mobility. Our simulations indicate temperature-dependent dynamical heterogeneity in the Na-MMT model, supported by experimental studies and quantified local molecular stiffness distribution. These findings enhance our understanding of the tensile response and dynamical heterogeneity of Na-MMT clay under extreme conditions, aiding the development of clay minerals for engineering applications such as nuclear waste storage and shale gas extraction.}

Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polyethylene (PE) are used as representative polar and nonpolar polymers, respectively. A modified order parameter is introduced to quantify the degree of two-dimensional (2D) crystallization of polymer chains. Our results show that PVA and PE chains exhibit significantly different crystallization behavior. PVA chains tend to form a more rounded, denser, and folded-stemmed lamellar structure, while PE chains tend to form an elongated straight pattern. The presence of oxidation groups on the GO substrate reduces the crystallinity of both PVA and PE chains, which is derived from the analysis of modified order parameter. Meanwhile, the crystallization patterns of polymer chains are influenced by the percentage, chemical components, and distribution of the oxidation groups. In addition, our study reveals that 2D crystalized polymer chains exhibit different melting behavior depending on their polarity. PVA chains exhibit a more molecular weight-dependent melting temperature than PE chains, which have a lower melting temperature and are relatively insensitive to molecular weight. These findings highlight the critical role of substrate and chain polarity in the crystallization and melting of polymer chains. Overall, our study provides valuable insights into the design of graphene-based polymer heterostructures and composites with tailored properties.}

  abstract={When a thin sheet is confined to a volume much smaller than its length (or width), it forms a complex state of sharp bends, point-like developable cones (d-cones) and extended ridges known as crumpled matter. One interesting feature of this state, is its high resistance to compression given its light weight. While the origins of this strength still remain a matter of debate, much has been learned through simple experiments and models. Very little work has explored how crumpling is affected by the sheet's topology, which is curious given the close relation between geometry and mechanics. In this work, we couple confocal microscopy with simple force experiments and coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) simulations to explore how adding cuts to a sheet alters its behavior in the crumpled state. We find that cutting does not significantly alter the overall compressive behaviour: force scales as a power law irrespective of cuts and magnitudes are only slightly reduced by cutting. Remarkably, when examining regions of high curvature in the crumpled sheets we see evidence of significant changes in the distribution of curvature in cut sheets.}

Unfortunately, it is still unclear how to predict exactly how much compression a given crumple can hold, suggesting that basic physical processes might have been overlooked by current models. In this work, we examine the effects of surface/surface interactions (adhesion) on the overall compressive strength of a model crumpled polymer film. We perform both experiments and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to identify three notable features: (1) compressive strength increases when adhesion is present but does not depend directly on the magnitude of adhesive strength, (2) the work done during a compression cycle depends directly on the magnitude of adhesive strength, and (3) a new length scale is required to characterize the crossover between sticky and non-sticky crumpled matter.}

Here, we report the results of a systematic coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) simulation study of the crumpling process of graphene sheets at varying degree of reconstructed SV defects. We find that two-dimensional (2D) defective graphene sheets with larger degree of SV defects reconstruction exhibit more wrinkling in equilibrium than pristine graphene and less reconstructed defective sheets. By evaluating the evolution of potential energy of the sheet during the crumpling process, our results show that the reconstructed SV defects reduce the adhesion properties while greatly increase the angle potential energy. Moreover, the shape descriptor analysis shows less self-folding and self-adhering upon crumpling for sheets with larger degree of defects reconstruction. The analyses of the sheet pressure and bulk modulus indicate that the larger the degree of defects reconstruction, the more difficult it is to compact the sheet into a crumple, corresponding to a greater bulk modulus. The evaluation of stress distribution of the sheet further reveals the stress heterogeneity arising from defects and crumpling. Our findings highlight the critical role of reconstructed SV defects in the crumpling process of graphene sheets, which has significant implications for the tailored design of crumpled defective materials.}

Our results show that the Young’s modulus can be quantitatively predicted by the power-law scaling relationship with initial packing density, where higher density leads to an increase in both modulus and strength. By evaluating the molecular local stiffness during the tensile process, our findings show that CNC film with a higher density exhibits a higher degree of dynamic heterogeneity, which is greatly reduced under deformation. Our results further demonstrate that randomly oriented CNCs tend to be more aligned with the tensile direction associated with higher free volume and porosity during the deformation; however, the dynamics of CNC is more associated with the degree of local packing and density rather than the CNC orientation. Our study provides fundamental insights into deformational mechanisms associated with the microstructure and dynamics of CNC films at a molecular level, aiding in the tailored design of cellulose-based materials for their mechanical performance.}

Among the various properties of these sheets, interfacial adhesion critically contributes to the formation of crumpled structures. Here, we present a coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) simulation study to explore the fundamental role of self-adhesion in the crumpling behaviors of macromolecular sheets having varying masses or sizes. By evaluating the potential energy evolution, our results show that the self-adhesion plays a dominant role in the crumpling behavior of the sheets compared to in-plane and out-of-plane stiffnesses. The macromolecular sheets with higher adhesion tend to form a self-folding planar structure at the quasi-equilibrium state of the crumpling and exhibit a lower packing efficiency as evaluated by the fractal dimension of the system. Notably, during the crumpling process, both the radius of gyration Rg and the hydrodynamic radius Rh of the macromolecular sheet can be quantitatively described by the power-law scaling relationships associated with adhesion. The evaluation of the shape descriptors indicates that the overall crumpling behavior of macromolecular sheets can be characterized by three regimes, i.e., the less bent, intermediate, and highly crumpled regimes, dominated by edge-bending, self-adhesion, and further compression, respectively. The internal structural analysis further reveals that the sheet transforms from the initially ordered state to the disordered glassy state upon crumpling, which can be facilitated by greater self-adhesion. Our study provides fundamental insights into the adhesion-dependent structural behavior of macromolecular sheets under crumpling, which is essential for establishing the structure-processing-property relationships for crumpled macromolecular sheets.}

  abstract={An analysis model of the dynamic properties of 2–2 multi-layered cement-based piezoelectric composite under impact load and its definite problems are investigated based on the theory of piezo-elasticity in this paper. The theoretical solutions are obtained according to the Duhamel integral and variable separation method. After analyzing the physical meaning and the convergence of the theoretical solutions, the numerical simulations of the composite are presented by utilizing the various loads including the transient step, the transient haversine wave and the transient isosceles triangle loads. The theoretical solutions are compared with the numerical simulations, as well as reported results. Excellent agreements among these results are found. In addition, the influences of the number of layers of the composite and the piezoelectric parameters on the response of dynamic properties are discussed.

  abstract={Cement-based piezoelectric composite, has been widely used as a kind of smart material in structural health monitoring and active vibration control. However, transient dynamic loads such as impact loads may cause serious damage to the composite. Considering the electrode layer effect, this paper aimed to investigate the theoretical response of a 2-2 cement-based piezoelectric composite sensor subjected to an impact load. The vibration behaviors are analyzed by using the mode summation method and the virtual work principle. To simulate the impact load, transient haversine wave loads are assumed in the numerical simulation. Close agreements between theoretical and numerical solutions are found for peak transient haversine wave loads larger than 500 kPa, therefore proving the validity of the theory. Moreover, the influence of the electrode material and geometrical parameters on the dynamic characteristics of this sensor are considered. The present work should be beneficial to the design of this kind of sensor by taking into account the electrode layer effect.}

  abstract={Cement-based piezoelectric materials are widely used due to the fact that compared with common smart materials, they overcome the defects of structure-incompatibility and frequency inconsistency with a concrete structure. However, the present understanding of the mechanical behavior of cement-based piezoelectric smart materials under impact load is still limited. The dynamic characteristics under impact load are of importance, for example, for studying the anti-collision properties of engineering structures and aircraft takeoff-landing safety. Therefore, in this paper, an analytical model was proposed to investigate the dynamic properties of a 2-2 cement-based piezoelectric dual-layer stacked sensor under impact load based on the piezoelectric effect. Theoretical solutions are obtained by utilizing the variable separation and Duhamel integral method. To simulate the impact load and verify the theory, three types of loads, including atransient step load, isosceles triangle load and haversine wave load, are considered and the comparisons between the theoretical results, Li’s results and numerical results are presented by using the control variate method and good agreement is found. Furthermore, the influences of several parameters were discussed and other conclusions about this sensor are also given. This should prove very helpful for the design and optimization of the 2-2 cement-based piezoelectric dual-layer stacked sensor in engineering.}

  abstract={In this chapter, the mechanical behavior of supramolecular assemblies of two-dimensional (2D) materials simulated using coarse-graining (CG) modeling approaches is discussed. Taking graphene as an exemplary system of 2D materials, four different CG models of graphene and graphene oxide with distinct mapping schemes and parameterizations are introduced. The applications of these CG models to simulate supramolecular assemblies, such as 3D foams or nacre-inspired graphene-polymer nanocomposites, are discussed. First, the crumpling behaviors of pristine graphene and graphene with defects are reviewed, emphasizing the role of adhesion in the crumpling process. Next, the modeling of 3D graphene foams is discussed, in particular the effects of temperature on their structural, dynamic, and mechanical responses. Following the foams, multilayer graphene assemblies (MLGs) are introduced, and the role of strain localization effects and energy dissipation mechanisms are discussed. Finally, we will discuss how CG models can be used to reveal the strengthening role of 2D materials in nanocomposites (i.e., toughness, and mechanical and viscoelastic properties). The examples presented in this chapter highlight the capability of multiscale CG modeling toward unraveling the complex behaviors of supramolecular assemblies of 2D materials.}

  abstract={Atomistic modeling has significantly contributed to the establishment of computer simulations as the third pillar of science, together with experiments and theory. Atomistic modeling involves many disparate fields of science, ranging from classical and statistical mechanics to quantum chemistry, numerical methods, or algorithmic developments. The great depth of each of those individual areas makes the mastering of atomistic simulation a daunting challenge. In this chapter, we attempt to fill the gray area between fundamental theory and hands-on applications by providing a practical overview of the theoretical machinery underlying atomistic simulations while at the same time outlining software-agnostic guidelines to perform simulations. Our goal is for the reader to understand the fundamentals of atomistic modeling and to be able to carry out simple atomistic simulations responsibly. To that end, instead of extensively focusing on the intricacies of the foundational aspects, which are tremendously important for experts in the field, we focus on aspects of the simulations that the practitioner will need to control, and therefore understand, when carrying out a simulation. We expect the reader to have some working knowledge on thermodynamics, physics, and chemistry but not be an expert in statistical mechanics, quantum chemistry, or scientific computing. For the motivated self-learner, we have tried to provide references throughout the chapter to other work with more in-depth treatments of the different topics.}
