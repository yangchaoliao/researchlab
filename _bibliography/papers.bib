  abstract={Glass ceramics are functional materials created through controlled crystallization of base glasses, combining properties of both glasses and ceramics. Typically with crystallinity below 0.9, their crystal sizes, from nanometers to micrometers, are governed by processing conditions and nucleating agents. Smaller crystals enhance optical transparency, while larger ones improve mechanical strength, making the optimization of this tradeoff a critical challenge in composition and process design. We address this challenge quantitatively using continuum-level multiphysics modeling for both electromagnetic wave propagation and material fracture, which generate guiding curves for optimal property selection. Integrating these models incorporating microstructure effects and experimental data where the chemistry is encoded, we establish a comprehensive composition-processing-microstructure-properties map. Crucially, the one-to-one mapping from the microstructure space to the performance enables a physics transfer approach, supporting data-driven glass development of glass ceramics with tailored optical and mechanical properties, for reduced experimental costs and accelerated processes of material design.}

  abstract={Polymer-grafted graphene (PgG) sheets are of interest in the development of functional nanocomposite materials for sensing, energy storage, and coatings. Although extensive studies have reported on various physical properties of PgG sheets, our understanding of the fundamental structural behavior of crumpled PgG sheets is still lacking. Here, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the crumpling behavior of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)-grafted graphene (PMMA-g-G) sheets with varying grafting densities based on previously developed coarse-grained (CG) models of PMMA and graphene. The simulation results reveal that the conformation of PMMA-g-G sheets in the initial equilibrium is controlled by the polymer grafting density and can be characterized into three different regimes (i.e., flat, folded, and wrinkled states), where the local distribution of PMMA on the graphene affects the local curvature of the sheet. By analyzing the total potential energy, shape descriptor, and conformation of the system during the crumpling process, it is found that the increase in grafting density reduces the self-adhering and self-folding behaviors of the sheet while making the bending behavior dominate the crumpling process. Moreover, the evaluation of the local curvature, stress distributions, and cross-sectional patterns of crumpled PMMA-g-G sheets further uncovers the reduced degree of mechanical heterogeneity due to the increased grafting density. Our study provides fundamental insights into the conformational behavior of PMMA-g-G sheets in equilibrium and crumpled states in relation to grafting density, which is crucial for establishing the structure–property relationships for leveraging crumpled polymer-grafted sheets in functional nanocomposites.}

  abstract={Upon crumpling, graphene sheets yield intriguing hierarchical structures with high resistance to compression and aggregation, garnering a great deal of attention in recent years for their remarkable potential in a variety of applications. Here, we aim to understand the effect of Stone–Wales (SW) defects, i.e., a typical topological defect of graphene, on the crumpling behavior of graphene sheets at a fundamental level. By employing atomistically informed coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) simulations, we find that SW defects strongly influence the sheet conformation as manifested by the change in size scaling laws and weaken the self-adhesion of the sheet during the crumpling process. Remarkably, the analyses of the internal structures (i.e., local curvatures, stresses, and cross-section patterns) of crumpled graphene emphasize the enhanced mechanical heterogeneity and “glass-like” amorphous state elicited by SW defects. Our findings pave the way for understanding and exploring the tailored design of crumpled structure via defect engineering.}

  abstract={This study employs all-atomistic (AA) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the crystallization and melting behavior of polar and nonpolar polymer chains on monolayers of graphene and graphene oxide (GO). Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polyethylene (PE) are used as representative polar and nonpolar polymers, respectively. A modified order parameter is introduced to quantify the degree of two-dimensional (2D) crystallization of polymer chains. Our results show that PVA and PE chains exhibit significantly different crystallization behavior. PVA chains tend to form a more rounded, denser, and folded-stemmed lamellar structure, while PE chains tend to form an elongated straight pattern. The presence of oxidation groups on the GO substrate reduces the crystallinity of both PVA and PE chains, which is derived from the analysis of modified order parameter. Meanwhile, the crystallization patterns of polymer chains are influenced by the percentage, chemical components, and distribution of the oxidation groups. In addition, our study reveals that 2D crystalized polymer chains exhibit different melting behavior depending on their polarity. PVA chains exhibit a more molecular weight-dependent melting temperature than PE chains, which have a lower melting temperature and are relatively insensitive to molecular weight. These findings highlight the critical role of substrate and chain polarity in the crystallization and melting of polymer chains. Overall, our study provides valuable insights into the design of graphene-based polymer heterostructures and composites with tailored properties.}

  abstract={When a thin sheet is confined to a volume much smaller than its length (or width), it forms a complex state of sharp bends, point-like developable cones (d-cones) and extended ridges known as crumpled matter. One interesting feature of this state, is its high resistance to compression given its light weight. While the origins of this strength still remain a matter of debate, much has been learned through simple experiments and models. Very little work has explored how crumpling is affected by the sheet's topology, which is curious given the close relation between geometry and mechanics. In this work, we couple confocal microscopy with simple force experiments and coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) simulations to explore how adding cuts to a sheet alters its behavior in the crumpled state. We find that cutting does not significantly alter the overall compressive behaviour: force scales as a power law irrespective of cuts and magnitudes are only slightly reduced by cutting. Remarkably, when examining regions of high curvature in the crumpled sheets we see evidence of significant changes in the distribution of curvature in cut sheets.}

  abstract={As a thin sheet is crumpled up, it becomes more and more resistant to compression (making it a useful material system for packaging). Unfortunately, it is still unclear how to predict exactly how much compression a given crumple can hold, suggesting that basic physical processes might have been overlooked by current models. In this work, we examine the effects of surface/surface interactions (adhesion) on the overall compressive strength of a model crumpled polymer film. We perform both experiments and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to identify three notable features: (1) compressive strength increases when adhesion is present but does not depend directly on the magnitude of adhesive strength, (2) the work done during a compression cycle depends directly on the magnitude of adhesive strength, and (3) a new length scale is required to characterize the crossover between sticky and non-sticky crumpled matter.}
