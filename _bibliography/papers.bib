  abstract={Understanding the influence of reconstructed single vacancy (SV) defects on the crumpling behavior of graphene sheets is crucial for successful implementation of graphene in advanced technologies. Here, we report the results of a systematic coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) simulation study of the crumpling process of graphene sheets at varying degree of reconstructed SV defects. We find that two-dimensional (2D) defective graphene sheets with larger degree of SV defects reconstruction exhibit more wrinkling in equilibrium than pristine graphene and less reconstructed defective sheets. By evaluating the evolution of potential energy of the sheet during the crumpling process, our results show that the reconstructed SV defects reduce the adhesion properties while greatly increase the angle potential energy. Moreover, the shape descriptor analysis shows less self-folding and self-adhering upon crumpling for sheets with larger degree of defects reconstruction. The analyses of the sheet pressure and bulk modulus indicate that the larger the degree of defects reconstruction, the more difficult it is to compact the sheet into a crumple, corresponding to a greater bulk modulus. The evaluation of stress distribution of the sheet further reveals the stress heterogeneity arising from defects and crumpling. Our findings highlight the critical role of reconstructed SV defects in the crumpling process of graphene sheets, which has significant implications for the tailored design of crumpled defective materials.}

  abstract={Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) thin films draw considerable interest in engineering and technological applications due to their excellent mechanical and physical properties associated with dynamic and microstructural features. Here, we employ coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) simulations to investigate how the dynamics and microstructure change in the CNC films under tensile deformation. Our results show that the Young’s modulus can be quantitatively predicted by the power-law scaling relationship with initial packing density, where higher density leads to an increase in both modulus and strength. By evaluating the molecular local stiffness during the tensile process, our findings show that CNC film with a higher density exhibits a higher degree of dynamic heterogeneity, which is greatly reduced under deformation. Our results further demonstrate that randomly oriented CNCs tend to be more aligned with the tensile direction associated with higher free volume and porosity during the deformation; however, the dynamics of CNC is more associated with the degree of local packing and density rather than the CNC orientation. Our study provides fundamental insights into deformational mechanisms associated with the microstructure and dynamics of CNC films at a molecular level, aiding in the tailored design of cellulose-based materials for their mechanical performance.}

  abstract={Understanding the crumpling behavior of two-dimensional (2D) macromolecular sheet materials is of fundamental importance in engineering and technological applications. Among the various properties of these sheets, interfacial adhesion critically contributes to the formation of crumpled structures. Here, we present a coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) simulation study to explore the fundamental role of self-adhesion in the crumpling behaviors of macromolecular sheets having varying masses or sizes. By evaluating the potential energy evolution, our results show that the self-adhesion plays a dominant role in the crumpling behavior of the sheets compared to in-plane and out-of-plane stiffnesses. The macromolecular sheets with higher adhesion tend to form a self-folding planar structure at the quasi-equilibrium state of the crumpling and exhibit a lower packing efficiency as evaluated by the fractal dimension of the system. Notably, during the crumpling process, both the radius of gyration Rg and the hydrodynamic radius Rh of the macromolecular sheet can be quantitatively described by the power-law scaling relationships associated with adhesion. The evaluation of the shape descriptors indicates that the overall crumpling behavior of macromolecular sheets can be characterized by three regimes, i.e., the less bent, intermediate, and highly crumpled regimes, dominated by edge-bending, self-adhesion, and further compression, respectively. The internal structural analysis further reveals that the sheet transforms from the initially ordered state to the disordered glassy state upon crumpling, which can be facilitated by greater self-adhesion. Our study provides fundamental insights into the adhesion-dependent structural behavior of macromolecular sheets under crumpling, which is essential for establishing the structure-processing-property relationships for crumpled macromolecular sheets.}

  abstract={Understanding the complex structural behaviors of crumpled graphene at a fundamental level is of critical importance in various engineering and technological applications. Here, we present a coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) study for investigating structural behaviors of graphene sheets having varying sizes (or masses) during the crumpling process. The simulation results reveal that larger size graphene sheets at the initial two-dimension (2D) state tends to become more self-adhering and self-folding upon crumpling compared to the smaller ones, before forming a sphere-like highly crumpled structure. The fractal dimension of the crumpled graphene sheets, i.e., a measure of packing efficiency, is predicted to be D = 2.395 from our CG modeling, which is largely consistent with previous measurements. Remarkably, the size-dependence of various structural properties of the crumpled graphene sheets, including radius of gyration, hydrodynamic radius, and viscosity radius, can be quantitively described by the power-law scaling relationships during the crumpling process. By systematically evaluating shape descriptors, it is found that the overall crumpling behaviors of graphene sheets can be characterized by three different regimes (i.e., less, intermediate, and highly crumpled states), which are associated with edge-bending, self-adhesion, and further compression mechanisms, respectively. Our study provides fundamental insights into the size-dependent structural behavior of graphene sheets under crumpling, which is crucial to develop the structure-property relationships towards designing and engineering crumpled matter.}

An arbitrary mechanical load acts on the free end of the composite in the form of pressure. The Taylor series expansion method is introduced for the arbitrary mechanical load, and the theoretical solutions of the composite are obtained mainly based on the eigenfunction expansion method, Duhamel integral, and Laplace transform. Comparisons between the theoretical results, numerical results, and four related theoretical studies are presented, and good agreements are found. Furthermore, the theoretical expression of magnification factors of the composite under the harmonic load are obtained and analyzed. In addition to providing a theoretical basis for the design and experimentation of 2-2 cement-based piezoelectric composites under the arbitrary loading, the theoretical methods presented in the article could be extended to analyze the dynamic characteristics of any multilayered composite structure.}

  abstract={Cement-based piezoelectric composite, has been widely used as a kind of smart material in structural health monitoring and active vibration control. However, transient dynamic loads such as impact loads may cause serious damage to the composite. Considering the electrode layer effect, this paper aimed to investigate the theoretical response of a 2-2 cement-based piezoelectric composite sensor subjected to an impact load. The vibration behaviors are analyzed by using the mode summation method and the virtual work principle. To simulate the impact load, transient haversine wave loads are assumed in the numerical simulation. Close agreements between theoretical and numerical solutions are found for peak transient haversine wave loads larger than 500 kPa, therefore proving the validity of the theory. Moreover, the influence of the electrode material and geometrical parameters on the dynamic characteristics of this sensor are considered. The present work should be beneficial to the design of this kind of sensor by taking into account the electrode layer effect.}

  abstract={Cement-based piezoelectric materials are widely used due to the fact that compared with common smart materials, they overcome the defects of structure-incompatibility and frequency inconsistency with a concrete structure. However, the present understanding of the mechanical behavior of cement-based piezoelectric smart materials under impact load is still limited. The dynamic characteristics under impact load are of importance, for example, for studying the anti-collision properties of engineering structures and aircraft takeoff-landing safety. Therefore, in this paper, an analytical model was proposed to investigate the dynamic properties of a 2-2 cement-based piezoelectric dual-layer stacked sensor under impact load based on the piezoelectric effect. Theoretical solutions are obtained by utilizing the variable separation and Duhamel integral method. To simulate the impact load and verify the theory, three types of loads, including atransient step load, isosceles triangle load and haversine wave load, are considered and the comparisons between the theoretical results, Li’s results and numerical results are presented by using the control variate method and good agreement is found. Furthermore, the influences of several parameters were discussed and other conclusions about this sensor are also given. This should prove very helpful for the design and optimization of the 2-2 cement-based piezoelectric dual-layer stacked sensor in engineering.}

  abstract={In this chapter, the mechanical behavior of supramolecular assemblies of two-dimensional (2D) materials simulated using coarse-graining (CG) modeling approaches is discussed. Taking graphene as an exemplary system of 2D materials, four different CG models of graphene and graphene oxide with distinct mapping schemes and parameterizations are introduced. The applications of these CG models to simulate supramolecular assemblies, such as 3D foams or nacre-inspired graphene-polymer nanocomposites, are discussed. First, the crumpling behaviors of pristine graphene and graphene with defects are reviewed, emphasizing the role of adhesion in the crumpling process. Next, the modeling of 3D graphene foams is discussed, in particular the effects of temperature on their structural, dynamic, and mechanical responses. Following the foams, multilayer graphene assemblies (MLGs) are introduced, and the role of strain localization effects and energy dissipation mechanisms are discussed. Finally, we will discuss how CG models can be used to reveal the strengthening role of 2D materials in nanocomposites (i.e., toughness, and mechanical and viscoelastic properties). The examples presented in this chapter highlight the capability of multiscale CG modeling toward unraveling the complex behaviors of supramolecular assemblies of 2D materials.}

Atomistic modeling involves many disparate fields of science, ranging from classical and statistical mechanics to quantum chemistry, numerical methods, or algorithmic developments. The great depth of each of those individual areas makes the mastering of atomistic simulation a daunting challenge. In this chapter, we attempt to fill the gray area between fundamental theory and hands-on applications by providing a practical overview of the theoretical machinery underlying atomistic simulations while at the same time outlining software-agnostic guidelines to perform simulations. Our goal is for the reader to understand the fundamentals of atomistic modeling and to be able to carry out simple atomistic simulations responsibly. To that end, instead of extensively focusing on the intricacies of the foundational aspects, which are tremendously important for experts in the field, we focus on aspects of the simulations that the practitioner will need to control, and therefore understand, when carrying out a simulation. We expect the reader to have some working knowledge on thermodynamics, physics, and chemistry but not be an expert in statistical mechanics, quantum chemistry, or scientific computing. For the motivated self-learner, we have tried to provide references throughout the chapter to other work with more in-depth treatments of the different topics.}
