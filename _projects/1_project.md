Our research aims to establish a physics-based, simulation-driven understanding of how nanoscale interactions, geometry, and microstructural imperfections govern the crumpling of graphene and related 2D sheet macromolecules. Using atomistically informed coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD), we quantify how initially flat sheets evolve into hierarchical, sphere-like crumpled architectures through coupled mechanisms of edge bending, self-adhesion-driven folding, and final-stage compression. Across graphene sheets, nanoribbons, and polymer-grafted graphene, our work reveals robust power-law scaling laws linking key structural metrics (e.g., radius of gyration and hydrodynamic/viscosity radii) to controllable design variables such as sheet size, adhesion strength, aspect ratio, defect topology, and grafting density. These results provide a predictive framework for tailoring packing efficiency (via fractal descriptors), mechanical heterogeneity, and compaction resistance—enabling rational design of crumpled graphene-based matter for functional nanocomposites, coatings, and energy-related applications.

### Highlights from our published work
<ul>
  <li>
    Universal crumpling regimes: Identified three crumpling regimes dominated by edge bending, self-adhesion, and further compression, offering a mechanistic “map” of crumpling pathways.
  </li>
  <li>
      Scaling and packing efficiency: Predicted fractal-like packing behavior and demonstrated size-/adhesion-dependent scaling relations for structural radii.
  </li>
  <li>
    Self-adhesion as a primary control knob: Showed that adhesion can dominate crumpling energetics and strongly modulate folding motifs and final packing efficiency.
  </li>
  <li>
    Defect engineering of crumpled graphene: Revealed how reconstructed vacancy defects and Stone–Wales defects weaken self-adhesion, alter scaling behavior, increase stress/curvature heterogeneity, and promote glass-like internal structures—leading to higher resistance to compaction.
  </li>
  <li>
    Geometry and functionalization effects: Established aspect-ratio-dependent crumpling modes in graphene nanoribbons and demonstrated how polymer grafting density suppresses self-adhesion/self-folding while reducing mechanical heterogeneity in crumpled polymer-grafted graphene sheets.
  </li>
</ul>
