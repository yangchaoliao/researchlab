    Uniaxial compression of crumpled balls

Our research investigates the effective compressive mechanical behavior of crumpled sheet materials under uniaxial compression, combining controlled experiments with coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) simulations. We focus on identifying how surface interactions and geometric patterning influence the macroscopic stiffness of crumpled sheets, which serve as model systems for lightweight, load-bearing materials.

In our studies of [sticky crumpled matter](https://www.cell.com/matter/fulltext/S2590-2385(22)00181-3?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2590238522001813%3Fshowall%3Dtrue), we show that introducing surface adhesion enhances the compressive strength of crumpled sheets by nearly an order of magnitude, while leaving the governing force–compression scaling unchanged. Our simulations reveal that this strengthening effect persists down to the nanoscale and arises primarily from increased in-plane stretching of the sheet induced by adhesion, rather than from changes in large-scale folding geometry. These results establish adhesion as a robust design parameter for tuning compressive stiffness without altering fundamental scaling laws.

We further examine the role of [kirigami-inspired cut patterns](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2023/sm/d2sm01584f) on the compression response of crumpled sheets through experiments on polymeric and paper materials and CG-MD simulations of graphene. While kirigami cuts significantly reorganize the internal network of creases—modifying their orientation and spatial distribution—their influence on the effective compressive modulus remains modest. Our structural analyses indicate that macroscopic stiffness is governed mainly by the number of localized high-curvature defects, rather than by the orientation or continuity of long-range folds and ridges. These findings support a defect-based description of crumpling mechanics and clarify the limited role of crease networks in compression resistance.

Overall, our work provides fundamental insights into how adhesion, patterning, and internal defect statistics control the effective modulus of crumpled sheets, offering clear guidelines for the materials-by-design of lightweight crumpled structures with tailored compressive properties.
