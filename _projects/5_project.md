We study the crumpling assembly and mechanical response of thin sheets functionalized with micro/nanoscale mechanical interlocking fasteners, such as mushroom-shaped hooks. Upon contact, these fasteners form a reversible “locking” interface—high resistance to in-plane sliding, yet peelable and reconfigurable under sufficient normal load—thereby strongly reshaping the relaxation pathways and long-term stability of crumpled spherical aggregates. Using coarse-grained sheet models and reproducible crumpling/compression protocols, we systematically uncover how the evolving interlock network governs multi-stage axial compression behavior and energy dissipation mechanisms, and we establish scaling laws and design maps linking fastener geometry/density with sheet size and stiffness. This work aims to provide rational principles for high-dissipation cushioning, recoverable energy-absorbing structures, and reconfigurable mechanical metamaterials.
