We use large-scale molecular dynamics simulations to study the collective dynamics and mechanical behavior of assembled carbon systems, including folded graphene ensembles, carbon nanotube packings, fullerene assemblies, and related confined box geometries. These systems exhibit emergent properties governed by interparticle interactions, topology, and packing rather than by individual building blocks.

We focus on microscopic dynamics and dynamic heterogeneity, quantified through mean-square displacement, Debye-Waller factor, and string-like cooperative motion, to elucidate relaxation mechanisms and cage effects in dense and disordered carbon assemblies. These dynamical descriptors provide a direct link between atomic-scale rearrangements and mesoscale transport behavior.

We further investigate the mechanical and rheological responses of carbon assemblies under shear, tension, and compression, revealing how structural organization and collective motion control stiffness, yielding, viscosity, and energy dissipation. This work establishes an atomistic framework for connecting assembly, dynamics, and mechanics in nanocarbon materials, with implications for the design of graphene- and nanotube-based structural and functional systems.
